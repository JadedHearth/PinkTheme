## About

Pink-Theme is a theme for the [Omega](https://github.com/Omega-Numworks/Omega) theme engine, an extension to Numworks' Epsilon.

## Installation

While compiling Omega or Upsilon, add the `THEME_NAME` and `THEME_REPO` flag :

```
make THEME_REPO=https://github.com/WoodenMaxim/PinkTheme.git THEME_NAME=upsilon_pink
```

(At least theoretically, I haven't gotten it to work properly ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ )

See [Upsilon](https://github.com/UpsilonNumworks/Upsilon/tree/upsilon-dev/) for more information on compilation.
